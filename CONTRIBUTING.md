# Modular-Discord-Bot Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to VitePress. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct]([https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Stax124/Modular-Discord-Bot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

## Development Setup
